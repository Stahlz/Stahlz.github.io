<h1>Good Day Fellow InfoSec Folk</h1>

<p>
I am Joshua Whitaker.
Currently i am working as a Incident Responder in HealthCare, and i have experience in threat intel, threat hunting, and security automation
The main objective of this blog is to provide walkthroughs, tips, tricks on setting up a non-attributinal network.
As well as general information related to privacy and security.

</p>
<b>Why would you ever need a Non-Attributional network?</b>
<p>
Maybe you need to do research on an external host, and don't want to tip off an attacker by showing your public ip address.
Your a pentester who wants to conceal their identity, for a campaign your running.
Even someone who's just privacy concious about goverment surveillance, and wants to decrease their digital footprint.
